# Possible Data Sets:
- [Book Recommendation Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset?select=classicRec.png)
   - This Data Set is good because it contains language data that we can easily process. We can take inspiration from the codes that have been made, and take it a step further by implementing a GNN architecture.
- [Jester Datasets](https://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/)
   - 6.5 million anonymous ratings of jokes by users of the Jester Joke Recommender System.
